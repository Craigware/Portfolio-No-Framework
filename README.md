# Portfolio-No-Framework
    My portfolio website! I decided to not use any framework because in the past
I've always just used Django or React. I will be honest I really liked the
work flow of it. At least for an individual working solo on a code base.<br>
 <br>
    I liked being able to create my own file structuring methods, did miss some
things though. My HTML and CSS files being quite large in development was not
the most enjoyable.

## Features

### Generic.js
    Some generic classes and functions for simplicity across multiple files.

#### Classes
- ##### Vector2(Number x, Number y)
    Holds two values, useful in a lot of cases.
    ###### Methods 
    - Compare(Vector2 Other)
    - Randomize(Number min, Number max, Array dimension)
    - RandomizeX()
    - RandomizeY()
#### Functions
- ##### Delay(Number ms)
    Creates a promise for a timeout of ms milliseconds.

### Techballs
    Created a physics engine in Javascript because I wanted to have an animation
of me throwing different techs onto the screen but thought just a generic
animation would be BORING! So I made it dynamic.
