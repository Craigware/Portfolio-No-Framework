# Portfolio No Framework
Hello, welcome to my portfolio website project. I am creating a
front end application to showcase a little more personal side of
me. I've decided not to use a framework with this project because
I am the solo developer. I would also like to challenge myself 
without looking up someone elses source code. I want to create a
problem for myself, and solve it. No frameworks, no copy pasta.

# Current Features
- Physics engine
- Typing Effect
- Erasing Effect

# Future
I am going to work on documentation later as the project goes on.
I want to seperate the physics system I made from the project so
maybe I can use it again in the future.

I also want to create my own CSS library as time goes on.
